# AuroraSky
 This Go program is a Slack bot that integrates with Wit.ai for natural language processing and Wolfram Alpha for answering queries. It starts by loading environment variables and initializing the Slack bot, Wit.ai client, and Wolfram Alpha client. The bot listens for a specific command, processes the user's query via Wit.ai, extracts relevant information using gjson, and queries Wolfram Alpha for an answer. The response is sent back to the user in Slack. Additionally, it logs command events for analytics and handles errors gracefully. The bot runs within a cancellable context, ensuring clean shutdowns.
